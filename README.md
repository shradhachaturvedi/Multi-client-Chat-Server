# Multi-client-Chat-Server
Implements networking by allowing multiple clients to connect to a single server. Both client and server, can exchange messages. Each client can disconnect anytime whereas the server will remain active until all clients disconnect.
First you have to run the server file. When it is running, you can run the client file as many times you want to create a client.
